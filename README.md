# ArchiAI: Intelligent Architectural & Interior Design Assistant

## Overview

ArchiAI is a cutting-edge AI-powered platform combining deep learning, data analysis, and prompt engineering to revolutionize architectural and interior design workflows. This project leverages state-of-the-art neural networks to generate optimized layouts, budget-conscious solutions, and realistic visualizations, tailored to unique client needs — from compact urban apartments to luxury villas and specialized spaces.

Developed in collaboration with AI Open, ArchiAI aims to push the boundaries of design automation and creative assistance.

## Features

- AI-Driven Space Optimization: Automatically generate efficient, functional floor plans based on user inputs, budget, and spatial constraints.
- Realistic Visualizations: Produce photorealistic 3D renders of interiors using generative models.
- Budget-Aware Design: Customize design proposals within specified financial limits.
- Contextual & Cultural Sensitivity: Integrate cultural and religious design elements, e.g., Islamic architectural symbolism.
- Floral School Case Study: Specialized module to design a floristic school for Dubai, integrating client preferences and local constraints.
- Prompt Engineering Interface: Enable designers to customize AI behavior via natural language prompts for maximum creativity and control.
- Deep Learning Backbone: Employ advanced neural networks trained on architectural datasets for superior performance.
